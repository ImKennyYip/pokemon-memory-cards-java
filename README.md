# [Memory Card Game](https://youtu.be/FxDirbh3tXc)
 In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a java match card memory game using Pokemon Energy Cards with the built-in java awt/swing graphics library. 

Throughout this tutorial, you will learn how to randomly place cards onto the board, use a Timer to create a delay before flipping the cards, create click handlers for selecting two cards and checking if they match, track and display error counts, and create a restart game button to shuffle and reorder the cards.

## Homework:
You can continue working on this project if you like. You can look for new card assets online and change the card images if you'd like. In addition, you can add/remove rows and columns to give the game varying difficulty. In this tutorial, we don't make a check to see if the user has flipped all the cards since it is a trivial task, but you can add a check to see if all cards are matched. To do so, you would create an int variable to increment every time the player gets a match. Another feature you can add is a stopwatch feature to see how fast you can match all the cards. For more of a challenge, you can add an option for a 2 player version where you alternate between 2 players on the same computer to see who gets the most matches. If a player gets a match, they will be allowed to go again.
